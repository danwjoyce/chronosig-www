# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am currently a research scientist on medical NLP in the team, with a mathematical background. Prior to that, I obtained my dual bachelor's from Manchester and Tianjin, followed by a master’s in computational maths from Mathematical Institute at Oxford. After my graduation, I started as a research assistant at the department of psychiatry, Oxford, working on cell microscopy and the explainability of deep learning for inference. I always want to combine both the broad availabilities of deep learning models and theoretical improvements to serve proper and useful applications to the public. My interests basically lie in pretrained language models (PLM), attention mechanisms, graph representations, and knowledge graphs. I am also interested in data analysis and exploring using ML methods for fairness and trustworthiness to ensure the algorithms are human-centered.

- Machine learning
