<p>As someone working in public and patient involvement (PPI) for 20 years, I quake whenever IT (information technology), machine learning (ML), data science – and latterly – the apparently more general term AI (artificial intelligence) are mentioned.</p>
<p>In this inaugural blog post for the CHRONOsig project, I will outline some core concepts and explain why PPI is required front-and-centre in the project.</p>
<p>Why did I become involved? Extracting information from large data sets, to analyse patterns and trends in disease and illness is the future for medical science. However reluctant I am to embrace this technology I have no option but to do so if I wish to be informed and importantly, influence adoption. So, four years ago I became a member of the CRIS-Oxford (Case Record Interactive Search) Oversight group. UK-CRIS is a national programme to develop the clinical record (often called the electronic health record, or EHR) into a data asset and research tool for NHS Mental Health Trusts. It was through this work I met one of the researchers who later became involved in the CHRONOsig project.</p>

<p>Firstly, what is CHRONOsig? CHRONOsig stands for CHRONOlogical SIGnatures. It is a project, funded by the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), to develop a clinical decision support tool (CDST) that will deliver accurate, explainable and justified recommendations to assist clinicians expedite access to the right secondary mental health care.</p>
<p>To access specialist, secondary mental health care, a person must usually be referred to a community mental health team (CMHT), who review the referral alongside the person’s historical medical notes and then decide how to proceed. Referral and triage processes lack transparency (to patients and referrers), are capricious (with CMHTs appearing to use referral criteria and thresholds inconsistently) and result in frustration from ‘referral bouncing’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chew-graham2007" role="doc-biblioref">Chew-Graham et al. 2007</a>)</span> (Chew-Graham et al., 2007). Attempts at improving this interface – for example, with GPs and CMHTs using a standardised referral tool to ‘grade’ patient’s severity and unmet needs – have yielded poor results (Slade et al., 2008). Patient care is delayed because they are being triaged multiple times, by different teams, who may disagree on the most appropriate treatment team for the patient’s needs. It is hoped that CHRONOsig will lead to improved and more accurate triage outcomes by automating some parts of the triage process.</p>
