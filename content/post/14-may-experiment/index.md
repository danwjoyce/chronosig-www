As artificial intelligence (AI) promises to become a larger part of the clinical workflow in healthcare, we need to understand how clinicians and AI can "work together".  In medical applications of AI, we often hear how an AI tool either equals or outperforms clinicians.  

However, when we eventually deploy these tools in clinical workflows, the reality is more likely to be that clinicians will use the outputs of these tools to inform or **augment** -- rather than **replace** -- their own decision making processes. 

In chrono**sig**, we are trying to study how we can most usefully augment clinician's decision making with the outputs of clinical decision support tools (CDSTs).

To do this, we need to know how a clinician's decisions or beliefs (for example, about diagnoses, recommendations for treatments, estimating risk or prognostics) can be integrated with the outputs of an CDST. 

If you have 15 minutes, you can help us with this by completing an online experiment that consists of a short, engaging tutorial followed by a series of questions simulating the task of making a diagnosis with the help of a CDST.

We need people who are 

  * medical students 
  * medically-qualified at *any level* and in *any specialty*

If you know of -- or are a member of groups of medical students or medically-qualified people -- we would be grateful if you could circulate the link above to spread the word. 

Thanks for your time and attention

The chrono**sig** team
