**VOLUNTEERS NEEDED FOR ONLINE STUDY OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ASSISTED DECISION MAKING**

University of Oxford Central University Research Ethics Committee Reference: R80680/RE001

With new advances in artificial intelligence, clinical decision support tools (CDSTs) are an area of technology assisted healthcare that are receiving increasing attention. CDSTs take an input – i.e. data about a patient – and deliver an output in the form of a decision, recommendation or prediction. This output is presented alongside a certainty estimate – i.e. how certain or uncertain the tool is about its prediction. In diagnostic decision support tools, one can consider the output of the tool in the form of a CDSTs belief in a diagnosis, and the tool’s certainty (or uncertainty) in that belief. In order to utilise CDSTs in practice, clinicians will be required to interpret both the output of a tool, and its uncertainty estimate, and integrate this with their own clinical assessment. The aims of our study are to assess the ability of medically trained individuals to do this.

We are looking for:

  * medical students (any year)
  * and qualified medical doctor volunteers (any specialty, any career grade)

 Who are aged 18 and over, to participate in an online study to investigate the above aims. You are invited to complete a short survey for one session, taking approximately 20-30 minutes. 

 You would be asked to complete online tasks that examine how you interpret and process the output of an artificial intelligence clinical decision support tool.

If you would like to participate in the study, please follow the links below which will take you to a more detailed information sheet. There is no obligation to take part.

If you are interested but would like more information please contact Dan Joyce (email: dan.joyce@psych.ox.ac.uk), or Jonathan Cattrall (email: jonathan.cattrall@bnc.ox.ac.uk) at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford.

If you know of -- or are a member of groups of medical students or medically-qualified people -- we would be grateful if you could circulate the link above to spread the word. 

Thanks for your time and attention
