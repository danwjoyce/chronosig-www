# main text to display on event page
abstract: "Professor Iain Buchan will reflect on the data and analytic pandemic pivots, such as the Combined Intelligence for Population Health Action (www.cipha.nhs.uk) system that enabled the world’s first evidence on voluntary ‘mass testing’ for Covid-19 and the first re-opening of live music events in the Northern Hemisphere with near real-time dataflows and agile, actionable analytics. The same combination of care records, public health and administrative data is now fuelling the development of England’s integrated care systems (ICS). He will consider how networked ICS could borrow strength from each other, tackling current weaknesses of clinical prediction models and AIs. Further, he will reflect on how future AIs could augment managed self-care by closing the gap between data updates and meaningful actions."
