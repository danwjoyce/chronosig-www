A **free**, public one-day hybrid online & in-person event on the socio-technical aspects of Artificial Intelligence in Mental Health.

**Tuesday 12th July from 09:30am to 15:00 (UK Time)**

If you're interested in the chrono**sig** project or the broader topics and themes around AI for mental health applications, please come and join us.  The event is open to anyone (public, researchers, clinicians).  The day will feature a variety of speakers ranging from students, PPI experts, clinicians and researchers.  The emphasis is on socio-technical aspects of AI applied to mental health and the presentations and panel discussion will reflect a diverse range of backgrounds (not just artificial intelligence and machine learning) so there will be something for everyone.

We have a limited number of in-person places (35 in total) so the event will by hybrid physical and virtual/online to maximise opportunities for people to attend.  

Themes and Presentations
  * Digital triage in mental health
  * Natural Language Processing with electronic health records
  * Participatory design for AI in mental health
  * Patient & Public Involvement and stakeholder Impact Assessment for Artificial Intelligence in mental health
  * How to understand AI-augmented clinical decision making

The day concludes with a **Live Q&A Expert Panel Discussion** on:
  * Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in AI for mental health
  * Protected Characteristics â€“ overcoming under-representation and systematic missingness

Please register to attend (either in-person or online) [here](https://forms.office.com/r/veuwM6W7W4).  For those attending virtually, a link to the online event will be emailed to you.
