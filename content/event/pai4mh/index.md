abstract: "This virtual (online), [one-day workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/pai4mh/home?authuser=0) addresses the sociotechnical issues in healthcare AI/ML that are idiosyncratic to mental health. Mental illness is the complex product of biological, psychological and social factors that foreground issues of under-representation, institutional and societal inequalities, bias and intersectionality in determining the outcomes for people affected by these disorders – the very same priorities that AI/ML fairness has begun to attend to in the past few years.  Despite the history of impoverished material investment in mental health globally, in the past decade, research practices in mental health have begun to embrace patient and citizen activism (if at times, imperfectly) and the field has emphasised stakeholder (patients and public) participation as a central and absolutely necessary component of basic, translational and implementation science.   <br />

  <br />

This positions mental healthcare as something of an exemplar of participatory practices in healthcare from which technologists, engineers and scientists can learn.  For example, mental illness is largely expressed in language and behaviour such that the primary clinical tool is the interview and therefore patients’ data is predominantly collected as free-text clinical narratives.  Furthermore, sensitive patient characteristics (e.g. ethnicity, sexual orientation and identity) are poorly recorded for reasons including clinician and institutions’ transcultural illiteracy which leads to biased data.  <br />

  <br />

Uniquely, this workshop will invite and bring together practitioners and researchers rarely found together “in the same room”, including: under-represented groups with special interest in mental health and illness; psychiatry; psychology; allied mental health professions; technologists; scientists and engineers from the machine learning communities.  <br />
